# trans-neurodevelopment

This project reproduces elements of the analyses from Integrative analysis of 115 transcriptomic studies decodes the molecular landscape of neurodevelopmental disorders. The goal is to practice end-to-end RNA-seq analysis, from data acquisition and normalization to differential expression, enrichment, and visualization. The repo contains code, results, and figures that illustrate both technical workflows and biological insights, with reflections documented in a companion blog.
